"""Adapters between usage ORM rows and the `UsageWindowRow` value type.

The mapping itself is trivial, but it is shared by proxy, usage,
dashboard, and account-summary code. Pulling it into a single helper keeps
future ``UsageWindowRow`` changes from drifting across call sites.

Lives in ``app/modules/usage/`` rather than ``app/core/usage/types.py``
so that ``app/core/`` does not need to depend on ``app/db/models``.
