## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Upstream Responses transport strategy
For streaming Codex/Responses proxy requests, the system MUST let operators choose the upstream transport strategy through dashboard settings. The resolved strategy MAY be `auto`, `http`, or `websocket`, and `default` MUST defer to the server configuration default.

#### Scenario: Dashboard forces websocket upstream transport
- **WHEN** the dashboard setting `upstream_stream_transport` is set to `"websocket"`
- **THEN** streaming Responses requests use the upstream websocket transport

#### Scenario: Dashboard forces HTTP upstream transport
- **WHEN** the dashboard setting `upstream_stream_transport` is set to `"http"`
- **THEN** streaming Responses requests use the upstream HTTP/SSE transport

#### Scenario: Auto transport falls back when websocket upgrades are rejected
- **WHEN** the resolved upstream transport strategy is `"auto"`
- **AND** auto selection chose the websocket transport
- **AND** the upstream rejects the websocket upgrade with HTTP `426`
- **THEN** the proxy retries the request over the upstream HTTP/SSE transport

#### Scenario: Session affinity alone does not trigger websocket upstream transport
- **WHEN** the resolved upstream transport strategy is `"auto"`
- **AND** a request includes a `session_id`
- **AND** it does not include an allowlisted native Codex `originator` or explicit Codex websocket feature headers
- **THEN** the auto strategy MUST keep using the existing model-preference transport selection rules

#### Scenario: Auto transport honors websocket-preferred bootstrap models before registry warmup
- **WHEN** the resolved upstream transport strategy is `"auto"`
- **AND** the model registry has not loaded a snapshot yet
- **AND** the request targets a locally bootstrapped websocket-preferred model family such as `gpt-5.4` or `gpt-5.4-*`
- **AND** the request does not include the built-in `image_generation` tool
- **THEN** the proxy chooses the upstream websocket transport

#### Scenario: Auto transport prefers HTTP for image-generation tool requests
- **WHEN** the resolved upstream transport strategy is `"auto"`
- **AND** the request includes a built-in `image_generation` tool
- **THEN** the proxy chooses the upstream HTTP/SSE transport even if the model would otherwise prefer websocket

#### Scenario: Legacy settings preserve the pre-feature default
- **WHEN** transport selection runs against a legacy settings object that does not expose the newer upstream transport fields
- **THEN** the proxy MUST preserve the pre-feature HTTP transport default for model-preference auto-selection unless an explicit legacy websocket mode or native Codex websocket signal opts in
