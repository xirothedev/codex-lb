## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Usage capacity recognizes upstream ChatGPT plan types

The system MUST recognize account plan types returned by upstream ChatGPT auth and usage payloads when calculating absolute usage capacity. `prolite` MUST be treated as a supported account plan with Plus x5 capacity values (`1125.0` primary and `37800.0` secondary), while preserving the stored plan type value for display and request-log context.

#### Scenario: Pro Lite account contributes aggregate remaining credits

- **GIVEN** an active account whose stored `plan_type` is `prolite`
- **AND** its latest primary and secondary usage rows report `used_percent` below 100
- **WHEN** the system builds usage window summaries or per-account remaining credit values
- **THEN** the account contributes `1125.0` primary capacity and `37800.0` secondary capacity
- **AND** the computed remaining credits are non-zero according to the reported usage percent

### Requirement: Pro Lite accounts are eligible for Pro-gated models

The system MUST treat stored `prolite` account plan types as Pro-equivalent when evaluating model registry plan eligibility, while preserving the stored `prolite` value for display and request-log context.

#### Scenario: Pro Lite account can be selected for a Pro-gated model

- **GIVEN** an active account whose stored `plan_type` is `prolite`
- **AND** its latest primary and secondary usage rows are below the configured usage threshold
- **AND** the requested model is allowed for `pro` accounts by the model registry
- **WHEN** proxy account selection evaluates eligible accounts for the requested model
- **THEN** the Pro Lite account remains eligible for selection
- **AND** the selection does not fail with `no_accounts`
