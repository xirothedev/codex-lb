## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: API Key creation

The system SHALL allow the admin to create API keys via `POST /api/api-keys` with a `name` (required), `allowed_models` (optional list), `weekly_token_limit` (optional integer), `expires_at` (optional ISO 8601 datetime), and `assigned_account_ids` (optional list). The system MUST generate a key in the format `sk-clb-{48 hex chars}`, store only the `sha256` hash in the database, and return the plain key exactly once in the creation response. The system MUST accept timezone-aware ISO 8601 datetimes for `expiresAt`, normalize them to UTC naive for persistence, and return the expiration as UTC in API responses.

When `assigned_account_ids` is omitted or empty, the created key SHALL remain unscoped and apply to all accounts. When `assigned_account_ids` is provided with one or more valid account IDs, the created key SHALL enable account-assignment scope and persist those assignments.

#### Scenario: Create unscoped key without assigned accounts

- **WHEN** admin submits `POST /api/api-keys` without `assignedAccountIds`
- **THEN** the created key returns `accountAssignmentScopeEnabled = false`
- **AND** `assignedAccountIds = []`

#### Scenario: Create scoped key with assigned accounts

- **WHEN** admin submits `POST /api/api-keys` with `assignedAccountIds` containing valid account IDs
- **THEN** the created key returns `accountAssignmentScopeEnabled = true`
- **AND** `assignedAccountIds` matches the supplied accounts

#### Scenario: Reject unknown assigned account IDs on create

- **WHEN** admin submits `POST /api/api-keys` with an unknown account ID in `assignedAccountIds`
- **THEN** the system returns 400

### Requirement: Frontend API Key management

The SPA settings page SHALL include an API Key management section with: a toggle for `apiKeyAuthEnabled`, a key list table showing prefix/name/models/limit/usage/expiry/status, a create dialog (name, model selection, assigned-account selection, weekly limit, expiry date), and key actions (edit, delete, regenerate). On key creation, the SPA MUST display the plain key in a copy-able dialog with a warning that it will not be shown again.

#### Scenario: Create key with optional account scoping

- **WHEN** an admin opens the create API key dialog
- **THEN** the dialog shows the Assigned accounts picker
- **AND** leaving the picker at `All accounts` creates an unscoped key
- **AND** selecting one or more accounts creates a scoped key for only those accounts
