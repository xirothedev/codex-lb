## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Codex WebSocket wrapped errors follow official client shape

When serving `/backend-api/codex/responses` or bridge-backed Responses WebSocket traffic, the service MUST classify upstream `type: "error"` frames using the same wrapped-error shape that the official Codex client accepts: a non-2xx `status` or `status_code` field indicates an upstream HTTP-style error, and the error detail MAY appear either in a nested `error` object or in top-level fields such as `code`, `message`, `param`, and `error_type`.

Top-level error normalization MUST NOT treat the event discriminator `type: "error"` as the upstream error type. If the frame provides `error_type`, the service MUST use that value as the error type for classification/rewrites. Existing continuity protection remains authoritative: frames describing `previous_response_not_found` MUST be rewritten or recovered through the established `stream_incomplete` continuity path instead of exposing the raw upstream code or missing response id.

#### Scenario: status_code alias is classified as upstream error status

- **WHEN** an upstream Codex WebSocket frame is `{"type":"error","status_code":400,...}`
- **THEN** the service treats the HTTP-style error status as `400`
- **AND** applies the same error classification path as for `status: 400`

#### Scenario: top-level error_type is used for classification

- **WHEN** an upstream Codex WebSocket frame is `{"type":"error","status":400,"error_type":"invalid_request_error","code":"previous_response_not_found",...}`
- **THEN** the normalized error detail has `type = "invalid_request_error"`
- **AND** the event discriminator `type = "error"` is not used as the upstream error type

#### Scenario: top-level previous-response miss remains masked

- **WHEN** a `/backend-api/codex/responses` WebSocket follow-up has `previous_response_id`
- **AND** upstream emits a top-level `previous_response_not_found` wrapped-error frame using `status_code`
- **THEN** the downstream event is a retryable continuity failure such as `stream_incomplete`
- **AND** the downstream payload does not contain `previous_response_not_found`
- **AND** the downstream payload does not expose the missing previous response id
