## MODIFIED Requirements
### Requirement: Responses routing prefers budget-safe accounts
When serving Responses routes, the service MUST prefer eligible accounts that are still below the configured budget threshold over eligible accounts already above that threshold. If no below-threshold candidate exists, the service MAY fall back to the pressured candidates.

#### Scenario: Fresh Responses request avoids a near-exhausted account
- **WHEN** `/backend-api/codex/responses`, `/backend-api/codex/responses/compact`, `/v1/responses`, or `/v1/responses/compact` selects among multiple eligible active accounts
- **AND** one candidate is above the configured budget threshold
- **AND** another candidate remains below that threshold
- **THEN** the below-threshold candidate is chosen first
