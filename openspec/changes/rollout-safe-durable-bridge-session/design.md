## Overview

HTTP bridge continuity is no longer modeled as "live owner pod memory only".
This change introduces a durable continuity journal in Postgres that tracks:

- canonical bridge session keys
- alias mappings for `x-codex-turn-state`, `x-codex-session-id`, and `previous_response_id`
- lease-based executor ownership
- the latest replay anchor (`latest_response_id`) used for fresh upstream reattach

The existing in-memory bridge session remains the fast path, but correctness no longer depends on one pod retaining every alias in RAM.

## Data Model

### `http_bridge_sessions`

Stores one row per canonical bridge continuity key.

- `session_key_kind`, `session_key_value`, `session_key_hash`
- `api_key_scope`
- `owner_instance_id`, `owner_epoch`, `lease_expires_at`
- `state`
- `account_id`, `model`, `service_tier`
- `latest_turn_state`, `latest_response_id`
- `last_seen_at`, `closed_at`

### `http_bridge_session_aliases`

Stores replayable aliases scoped by API key identity.

- `alias_kind`
- `alias_value`, `alias_hash`
- `session_id`
- `api_key_scope`

## Ownership / Recovery Rules

1. Ring membership still computes a preferred owner in steady state.
2. Durable lookup runs before fail-closed continuity errors.
3. If a durable row exists, the request is canonicalized to that session key.
4. If the durable row has a live owner lease on another replica, owner-forward remains the preferred fast path.
5. If the durable row has `latest_response_id` and the request does not provide `previous_response_id`, the service injects that replay anchor before preparing the new upstream request.
6. When owner-forward fails or the live in-memory alias is missing, the service may create a fresh upstream websocket locally and continue from the durable replay anchor.
7. Recovery prefers the durable session's last successful `account_id` before falling back to the general account pool, with one bounded retry on transient same-account connect failures.

## Public Edge Contract

The public `/v1/responses` edge is responsible for normalizing recovery-path output before it reaches a gateway client.

- Non-stream collection always returns valid JSON or an OpenAI-style error envelope.
- Unknown or internal-only output items are normalized into gateway-safe message items when possible, otherwise dropped or converted into a deterministic server error.
- Streaming responses are wrapped so malformed SSE payloads or truncated streams terminate with `response.failed` rather than surfacing an invalid public stream.

## Ingress / Deployment Defaults

Ingress-backed deployments need responses-specific sticky routing semantics.

- General API ingress may continue to hash by `Authorization`.
- `/v1/responses` and `/backend-api/codex/responses` should use a dedicated ingress that hashes by `x-codex-session-id` instead of API key-wide affinity.
- Local and bundled smoke installs must not rely on startup migrations; schema migration is handled explicitly before serving traffic.
- The application container must export `CODEX_LB_ENCRYPTION_KEY_FILE` by default so restored encrypted account tokens remain decryptable on a read-only root filesystem.

## Shutdown / Drain

Before closing in-memory bridge sessions, the process marks durable rows owned by the instance as `draining`. When sessions are closed, the durable lease is released without deleting the continuity row or alias history.

## Readiness / Startup

Bridge-enabled readiness now depends on bridge registration completion, not only database reachability and active ring membership. Initial registration is attempted before startup yields; only failure paths fall back to background retry.

## Remaining Gap

This change targets zero-drop continuity for the **next turn** after owner restart or handoff failure.

It does **not** provide crash-safe migration of an already open streaming response from one process to another. A mid-stream pod crash can still interrupt the active response stream; the durable journal only guarantees that subsequent valid turns can recover via fresh upstream reattach.
