# Database Backends — Delta

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: PostgreSQL engines validate and recycle pooled connections

When `database_url` resolves to a PostgreSQL backend, the application MUST configure each async engine — both the request-path `engine` and the optional background-task `_background_engine` — with `pool_pre_ping=True` and a finite `pool_recycle` window. This is required so the application detects connections that the PostgreSQL server has silently closed (idle timeout, restart, network reset) before the first real query is dispatched on them, and so connections are cycled before they reach any reasonable upstream keep-alive boundary.

#### Scenario: Stale connections are rejected before checkout

- **WHEN** a pooled connection has been closed by the server while sitting idle
- **AND** that connection is the next one a session tries to use
- **THEN** SQLAlchemy issues a pre-ping (`SELECT 1`), detects the dead connection, and transparently replaces it
- **AND** the application returns `200` (or the real business-level result), not `500 server_error` with `asyncpg.InterfaceError: connection is closed`

#### Scenario: Pool recycle bounds connection age

- **WHEN** a pooled connection has been open longer than `database_pool_recycle_seconds`
- **AND** that connection is the next one a session tries to use
- **THEN** SQLAlchemy discards and replaces the connection before the next query
- **AND** the default `database_pool_recycle_seconds` is `1800` seconds

#### Scenario: SQLite backends are not affected

- **WHEN** `database_url` resolves to a SQLite backend (file or `:memory:`)
- **THEN** neither `pool_pre_ping` nor `pool_recycle` is configured on the engine
- **AND** existing SQLite-specific tuning (PRAGMAs, `busy_timeout`) is unchanged
