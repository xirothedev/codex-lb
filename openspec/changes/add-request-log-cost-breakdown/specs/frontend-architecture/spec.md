## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Request logs expose cost breakdown details
When a request log has sufficient usage data, the dashboard request-log API MUST expose raw input/output token counts and a cost breakdown that separates non-cached input, cached input, and output cost.

#### Scenario: Successful request log exposes token and cost segments
- **WHEN** a successful request log row has persisted input, cached-input, and output usage
- **THEN** `GET /api/request-logs` includes `inputTokens`, `outputTokens`, and `costBreakdown`
- **AND** `costBreakdown` includes `inputUsd`, `cachedInputUsd`, `outputUsd`, and `totalUsd`

#### Scenario: Request log output falls back to reasoning tokens
- **WHEN** a successful request log row has no persisted `output_tokens` and does have `reasoning_tokens`
- **THEN** `GET /api/request-logs` uses the reasoning-token value for `outputTokens`

#### Scenario: Request log response preserves shape for legacy partial data
- **WHEN** a successful request log row is missing one or more persisted token or cost segments
- **THEN** `GET /api/request-logs` still includes `inputTokens`, `outputTokens`, and `costBreakdown`
- **AND** any unavailable top-level token field is returned as `null`
- **AND** `costBreakdown` includes `inputUsd`, `cachedInputUsd`, `outputUsd`, and `totalUsd`
- **AND** any unavailable `costBreakdown` field is returned as `null`
- **AND** clients can render only the available token and cost segments without treating the row as invalid

### Requirement: Request detail dialog renders successful cost breakdowns
The dashboard request-log `View Details` dialog MUST render a `Cost` section under `Archive` for successful request rows and MUST hide the section for non-success rows.

#### Scenario: Successful request displays ordered cost details
- **WHEN** a request log detail dialog opens for an `ok` row with available breakdown data
- **THEN** the dialog displays the total cost first
- **AND** the dialog lists available cost segments in this order: input, cached, output
- **AND** each displayed segment includes its token count and matching currency value
- **AND** token counts use the same compact formatting as the request-log tokens column
- **AND** currency values are rounded to two decimals

#### Scenario: Missing cost segments are omitted without breaking the dialog
- **WHEN** a successful request log row is missing one or more token or cost segments
- **THEN** the dialog renders only the available segments
- **AND** if no segments are available the `Cost` section is hidden
